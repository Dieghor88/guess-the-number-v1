## GUESS THE NUMBER (an exercise from _Understanding Algorithms_)
---
### This was the first exercise from the book _Undertaning Algorithms_. I was supposed to come up with a function that would guess the number the user is thinking of using a binary searching system...but I am an absolute beginner at this so, I wrote a code for every possible scenario. The code is over 600 lines but to be honest I am proud I managed to make it work.
